# AI-Agent-Email-Handler

This is code that reads through your email and writes responses to those emails with AI. The responses are then placed in the drafts folder of your gmail account.

# BEFORE USE:
This code only works on gmail. If you use a different email provider, there's not much I can do about that yet.\
You need an OpenAI API key. If you wish to use a different algorithm, just change the code requesting the OpenAI API to the AI model of your choice\
You have to create a .env file, and enter your OpenAI API key as OPEN_API_KEY={your key here}\
Additionally, you should go into the config.py file and change anything you want to change
