# AI-Agent-Email-Handler

This is code that reads through your email and writes responses to those emails with AI. The responses are then placed in the drafts folder of your gmail account.

# BEFORE USE:
This code only works on gmail. If you use a different email provider, there's not much I can do about that yet.\
You need an OpenAI API key. If you wish to use a different algorithm, just change the code requesting the OpenAI API to the AI model of your choice\
You MUST enable app passwords. The password you should put in .env will be your APP PASSWORD.
