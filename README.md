# AI-Agent-Email-Handler

# BEFORE USE:
This code only works on gmail. If you use a different email provider, this app is not for you\
You need an OpenAI API key. If you wish to use a different algorithm, just change the code requesting the OpenAI API to the AI model of your choice\

Additionally, you should go into the config.py file and change anything you want to change
